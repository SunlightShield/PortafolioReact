                Although my work experiences have been mostly in the Front End area, I also use Python, C# and Java (Spring Boot)

                of data in various formats (tables, graphs, reports, etc.). I also provide support to the back area, helping with tasks
                database maintenance (SQL), Endpoint creation (C#) and automation and OCR tasks (Python).
