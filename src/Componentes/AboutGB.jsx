            Hello! I am a passionate Front End developer graduating in 2022 from the INACAP Technological University.
          My work experience has focused mainly on the Front End field, but I also have outstanding skills in Python, C# and Java (Spring Boot).
          <br />
          <br />
          In my current position, I am part of the dynamic Front End team at an innovative technology solutions company for Call Centers.
          As a leader in the design and creation of views, I efficiently unify Front End and Back End, manage API consumption and manage data in various formats
          (tables, graphs, reports, among others). My most frequent projects include CRM type developments and Call Center Scripts.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, I provide support to the Back End area, actively participating in database maintenance tasks (SQL), creation of Endpoints (C#) and
          contributing to automation and OCR (Python) initiatives. Outside of work hours, I spend time studying and preparing for future projects using Spring Boot.
          <br />
          <br />
          My approach goes beyond the professional routine. I'm an enthusiastic Dark Souls player, a true DC Comics Geek (Nightwing being my favorite Batman) and a passionate
          of board games, especially titles like Chakra and Ticket to Ride.
