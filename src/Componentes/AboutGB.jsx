            I am a Front End developer graduated in 2022 from the Inacap technological university. <br />
        Although my work experiences have been mostly in the Front End area, I also use Python, C# and Java (Spring Boot)
        In my current job, I am a member of the Front team in a Call Center technological solutions company <br />
        Where I am in charge of the design and creation of views, unification of the Front End and Back End, API consumption and manipulation
        of data in various formats (tables, graphs, reports, etc.), usually in CRM-type projects and Call Center Scripts.
        <br/>
        I also provide support to the back area, helping with tasks
        database maintenance (SQL), Endpoint creation (C#) and automation and OCR tasks (Python).
        In my free time I study and prepare to create projects using Spring Boot.
        <br/>
        Additionally, I am an avid Dark Souls player, a DC comics geek (Nightwing best batman) and a board game enthusiast (Chakra and Ticket to Ride).
