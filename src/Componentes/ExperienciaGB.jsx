             My professional journey in the field of computing began with a significant impact on
                    "Duo Transports". In this role, I was part of the Front End team, where I designed views and
                    Developed client functions in a web application using Vue, Vuetify and Javascript. Additionally, I provided support
                    to the Back End team, contributing to basic tasks with Firebase and ensuring the correct implementation of
                    SEO strategies.

                    <br />
                    Currently, I am an active member of the Front End team at Softeck, a company that represents the epicenter of
                    my professional challenges. My responsibility covers the design and creation of various views, as well as the capture
                    of data in forms, with a special focus on Call Center Scripts. My skills with React and JavaScript have been
                    key in creating and viewing reports in CRMs for various clients.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Additionally, I have expanded my horizons by collaborating with the Back End team. This involves the execution of
                    stored procedures in SQL, the development of Endpoints and APIs in C#. In a simultaneous project, I have also
                    dabbled in tasks related to Python.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This variety of experiences has not only enriched my skill set, but has also allowed me to address
                    projects comprehensively. I am excited to continue growing and bringing my passion and dedication to future challenges.
