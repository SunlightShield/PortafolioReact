            My first relevant work experience in the IT field was working at "Transportes Duo", I was part of the
                front end team, designing the views and creating the functions for the clients, in a Web application using Vue, Vuetify and Javascript
                <br />
                I also supported the back team, assisting with basic tasks using Firebase and ensuring correct use of SEO.
                <br />
                <br />

                I am currently working at the company Softeck, as a member of the Front End team, where I am in charge of the design and creation of the
                different views and data capture in forms, especially in Call Center Scripts, in addition to the creation and visualization of different
                reports in CRMs of various clients. I currently work with React and JavaScript, lately I have also adopted tasks from the BackEnd team,
                performing stored procedures in SQL, Endpoints and Apis in C# and in another simultaneous project, Python.
